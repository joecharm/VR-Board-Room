# VR Board Room

## Features
* Ability to walk around the scene with the VR controllers
* Collision on objects
* Custom PBR Assets

I have designed the VR Board Room experience to be an open and bright environment, perfect for meeting others. The area has been split into two primary sections, with the first being a large open outdoor area and the second an open plan building featuring a bright room. I made the decision to not add a roof as this could make some users feel claustrophobic, this is important if users are meeting for a long period of time.

To enhance the aesthetics of the scene I have added custom created 3D assets. The cabin helps to create a pleasing back-drop to the scene, being surrounded by vegetation and fences this helps to create an outdoor atmosphere. The bench helps to separate the large outdoor area and the positioned benches act as an informal meeting place.
